And be it always remembered, such extravagances
are not confined to the dark periods of the Middle
Ages. In ourown times we have records of matters
equally monstrous and incredible. The legends
os modern Fanatics and Enthusiasts are, to say
the least, as wild as those of the Monks of old.
The Travels of Bruce were sor along time put
upon a parallel with the marvels of Herodotus;
and the Philosophical TransactionS, to say no·

our Daily Papers‚ detail wonderful stories of
showers of blood, of irogS, and of stenae, of
storms and meteors, which, placed side by side

or on the shores of the Hebrides. And yet
there would be as much force in such an objec-

as there is for disputing the authenticity of the
Monkish Historians. Is the admixture of false-
hood and truth is allowed to be a sufficient
ground for rejecting evidence, no human record

Nor is it an objection‚ that the details of their
narratives are in some respects at variance. On
