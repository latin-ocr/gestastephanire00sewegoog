than the steady, the more calm and philoso-
phical work to which it forms so valuable an
appendage.

But at the same time it carries with it the
impress cf truth. In the first place, it may be
said, that it contains less of the marvellous, in
the way os legends and miracles, than any other
oi the writers ol' that age, not excepting the

the expense of his rivals and opponents. There
is the same love of what is noble, and good,
and high-minded, the same hatred oi all that
is sordid and base, as characterizcs the writings
of the Monlr of Malmsbury. Witness his indig-
nation at the ssight ol William of Ypres, ‘re-

genereus enthusiasm with which he defends the

policy of Stephcn, in affording succcur to his·

destitute foe the Count Hemy, the future King
of England, when that succour had been de·
nied by all on whom he bada claim, contrary
to the advice of his barons, and lrnowing iull
well that he was furnishing arms to be used
against himself.

Again, when we find our Author fully borne
out in his assertione hythe evidence of others,
and those too of opposite interests and senti-
mente, in great matters, it is only just to accord
him credcnce where he stands alone. The
character os Stephen as slretched by William of
Malmsbury, bears a close resemblance to that
delineated by the authores the ‘Gesta Stephani'
That there should be points of difference it is
only natural to conceive. There is no human
action which is not capable of an unfavourable
