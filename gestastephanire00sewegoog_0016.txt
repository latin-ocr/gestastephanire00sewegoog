extraordinary under such circumstances, each
confirms the other. ’

There is one, indeed, great difference between
the works of the Monk of Malmsbury and our

Author. The ‘Historia Novella' is not limited
to the events of England3 it embraces the whole
known world: Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Ger·
many, France, Normandy, each lurnish their
several topics3 matters ecclesiastica, as well
as politica] and biographical‚ find a place in his
pages; and marvellous legende, and important
State Papers, follow in close conjunction one af-
ter the other. Not so with the ‘Gesta Stephani!
This is confined to the personal history os Ste-
phen. Accordingly, facts are there met with,
which not only Malmsbury, but other writers,
have passed over3 and soenes described with
minute particularity which they have neglected,
or of which they were ignorant. We are trans-
ported at once into the camp os Stephen and his
Barons3 we are present at his Councils3 we are
hurried forward in the night-march3 we lurlr ln
the ambuscade; we take part in the storming
of castleS, and cities. Now we stand in the wlld
morasses of the Isle of Ely3 at another time we
reconnoitre the fortifications of Bristol; from
the hard-fought field of Lincoln, we are carried
to the walls of Oxsord3 from the dungeon os the
captive King, we hasten to witness the escape os
the Empress during all the severities os the De-
cember night. lt is one stirring series os events
of personal and individual interest; and in this
respect it partahes much more of the character of
a Romance than of History3 it resembles more
the metrical remnants of Barhour and Robert
of Gloucester (save that this is written in prose)
