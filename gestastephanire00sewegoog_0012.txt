in his narration, and given itthereby the stamp
of truth, and identity which all others have sailed
to attain.

Nor let it be objected that these ancient An·
nals are unworthy of credit-that they coutain in
them legende the most improbable, miracles that
berder on the absurd, if they do not approach the

blasphemans-that scenes are voften described iu
extravagant colours, and acts recorded that out-
rage probability and truth. We do not reject
the testimony of Livy or Herodotus on great
historica} points, because they recount prodi·
gies, and miracles, and descriptione of indifferent
things, which we know or believe to be false.
We do not discredit the accounts of the battlcs of
Cannae, or ThrasymenuS, or Salamis, because the
same person who has narrated these, has also
recorded the Bull talking in the Forum, or the
Monsters of Egypt. Nay, further, these very
improbabilities have their value; they put the
stamp of authenticityon the works themselves.
It would be menstruus to suppose a Monk of
Glastonbury, or St. Albane, using the language
and cold scepticism of Hume, or the liberalism
uf Lyttelton. Such a phencmenon would at
once proclaim a iorgery. Nor even supposing
such stories te be false, ought it to disparage

² the veracity os those by whom they are narrated. ,

They, indeed, only wrote what they believed to
be true, the miracles they recounted formed part
ef their faith3 andis they sometimes treated the
phenomena of nature, or what modern science
calls phenomena of natureae supernatura] visit·
ations, it may be reasonably doubted whether

¹ their very superstition was not the best voucher

sor their adherence to truth, a pledge at least that
they would not wilfully be guilty of salsehood.
