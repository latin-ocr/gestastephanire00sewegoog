Author of the ‘Gesta' being in the camp of '

Stephon, possibly his own Confessor, would natu*-
rally be acquainted with all the facts. We may
ι add, that the accurate Trevet to the full supports
our Author. -

gaze with admiration on the Torso of the Theseus
and the reliques of the Elgin Marbles3 our re-
grets that any part has perished, seem only to
increase our admiration for that which has been
preserved. Such is· the spirit in which to con-
template the works before us. Token together,
they constitute a valuable body of history. They
reciprocally develope the politice of contending
parties; they serve as guides whereby to arrive
at the probable springs of action: they supply
mutual defects of information3 they may serve .

been transcribed from an ancient MS. in the
